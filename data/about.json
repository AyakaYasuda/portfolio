  "profilePara2": "Ever since I started designing systems in my career and teaching myself programming, I've been obsessed with the feeling when I see the app working as planned after dealing with problems step by step. I love the idea that there's more yet to learn and update in the software development industry, which I believe leads to my self-growth consistently.",
